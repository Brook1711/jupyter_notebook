    "> From 1G to 5G, wireless channels have been traditionally considered to be uncontrollable. Thanks to the recent advances in meta-materials, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) <mark>have emerged as a new paradigm</mark> for controlling wireless channels intelligently, thus making it a revolutionary technique for future 6G wireless communications. However, due to the <mark>“double fading” effect</mark>, RIS only achieves a <mark>negligible capacity gain</mark> in typical communication scenarios, which however has been widely ignored in many existing works. In this paper, the concept of active RIS is proposed to break this fundamental physical limit. Different from the existing passive RIS that reflects signals passively without amplification, active RIS can actively amplify the reflected signals. We then develop a signal model for active RIS, which is validated through experimental measurements. Based on this new signal model, we analyze the capacity gain  chievable by active RIS and formulate the capacity maximization problem in an active RIS aided system. Next, a joint transmit and reflect precoding algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, extensive results show that, compared with the baseline without RIS, the existing passive RIS can realize a negligible capacity gain of only 3% in typical application scenarios, while the proposed active RIS can achieve a noticeable capacity gain of 129%, thus overcoming the fundamental limit of “double fading” effect.\n",

    "> Over the past few decades, wireless communications have provided society with significant benefits. From 1G to 5G, the system capacity has been significantly improved by ad vancing the transceiver design, while the wireless channels have been usually considered to be uncontrollable. Recently, with the interdisciplinary development of meta-materials, electromagnetics, and wireless communications, a revolutionary technique called reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been proposed [1]–[4], which offers a novel design paradigm by adding new degrees of freedom to intelligently control wireless channels for improved communications. Specifically, an RIS is an array composed of massive passive elements, which reflect electromagnetic signals in a desired manner so as to reconfigure the wireless environment [5]. Thanks to its high array gain, low cost, low power, and <mark>low noise</mark> [5]– [7], RIS is expected to improve channel capacity [8], extend coverage [9], and reduce power consumption [10] for future 6G communications. Additionally, RISs are projected to have other applications such as in WiFi [11], precision measurement [12], and navigation [13].\n",

    "> Due to the negligible noise introduced by passive RISs, one of the most essential benefits of RISs is the <mark>“square law” array gain</mark>. In particular, the array gain of an $N$-element RIS is proportional to $N^2$ , which is N times larger than that achievable by the standard massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) [5]. Benefiting from this advantage, RIS is expected to bring significant capacity gains in future 6G wireless networks. <mark>However, actually significant capacity gains are only observed in atypical communication scenarios where the direct link from the transmitter to the receiver is completely blocked or very weak [8]–[10], [14]–[16].</mark> By contrast, in the typical scenario where the direct link is not weak, the common RISs with hundreds of passive elements can only achieve negligible capacity gains [17]. The reason behind this phenomenon is the “double fading” effect introduced by RIS, i.e., the signals received via the reflection link <mark>suffer from large-scale fading twice</mark>. Particularly, the equivalent path loss of the transmitter RIS-receiver link is the product (instead of the summation) of the path losses of the transmitter-RIS link and RIS-receiver link, which is usually thousands of times larger than that of the direct link [17]. As a result, the “double fading” effect makes it almost impossible for passive RIS to achieve a noticeable capacity gain in typical wireless environment. Most existing works on RIS have bypassed this effect by only considering atypical scenarios with very poor direct links [8]–[10], [14]– [16]. Therefore, to advance the practicability of RIS for future 6G wireless networks, a critical issue must to be addressed is: How to overcome the fundamental limit of “double fading” effect of RIS?\n",
    "<br/> RIS的特性——<mark>“平方律增益”</mark>（square law）\n",
    "\n",
    "由于无源RIS引入的噪声可忽略不计，所以RIS的最基本好处之一就是“平方律”阵列增益。特别是，N元素RIS的阵列增益与N 2成正比，这比标准大规模多输入多输出（MIMO）可获得的阵列增益大N倍[5]。受益于此优势，RIS有望在未来的6G无线网络中带来巨大的容量增长。但是，实际上只有在非典型的通信场景中才能观察到显着的容量增益，其中从发射机到接收机的直接链路被完全阻塞或非常弱[8] – [10]，[14] – [16]。相比之下，在直接链路不弱的典型情况下，具有数百个无源元件的普通RIS只能获得微不足道的容量增益[17]。这种现象背后的原因是RIS引入的“双重衰落”效应，即通过反射链路接收的信号两次遭受大规模衰落。特别是，发射机RIS-接收机链路的等效路径损耗是发射机-RIS链路和RIS-接收机链路的路径损耗的乘积（而不是总和），通常比直接链路的路径损耗大数千倍。链接[17]。结果，“双衰落”效应使得无源RIS在典型的无线环境中几乎不可能获得明显的容量增益。现有的大多数关于RIS的著作都只考虑了具有非常差的直接联系的非典型场景[8]-[10]，[14]-[16]，从而绕过了这种影响。因此，要提高RIS在未来6G无线网络中的实用性，必须解决的关键问题是：如何克服RIS的“双重衰落”效应的基本限制？"

    ">It should be noted that, the proposed active RIS is fundamentally different from the RIS equipped with active radio frequency (RF) components [25], [26]. Specifically, some passive RIS elements are connected to additional active RF chains, which are used for baseband signal processing. In this way, these RIS elements are enabled to have the signal processing capabilities [25], [26]. On the contrary, the proposed active RIS has no these capabilities, which only reflects and amplifies the incident signal to strengthen the reflection link. Besides, although the proposed active RIS can amplify the incident signal, which is similar to the full-duplex amplify-and-forward (FD-AF) relay, their hardware structures and transmission models are actually quite different. Specifically, FD-AF relay is equipped with RF chains to receive the incident signal and then transmit it after amplification [27]. Due to the long delay of this process, it takes two time slots to complete the transmission of a symbol, and the received signal at the receiver in a time slot actually carries two different symbols, which are transmitted by the transmitter and the FD-AF relay, respectively [27]. Thus, FD-AF has two different transmission models in two adjacent time slots [27, Eq. (22), Eq. (25)], while the proposed active RIS has only one transmission model (3) in every time slot."
